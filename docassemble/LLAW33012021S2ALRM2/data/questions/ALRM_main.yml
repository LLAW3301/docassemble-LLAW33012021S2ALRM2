  Welcome to CSP Connect!
  
  This App has been developed for the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement (ALRM) and their legal team who need assistance connecting their clients to services which help them get back on track after legal assistance.
  
  
  Theese services may include drug and alcohol support, homelessness, mental health, housing, health and food.
  
  
  CSP Connect finds and narrows down service providers for the specific client, based on the information the lawyer enters in the App. Therefore, the support services referred to clients are personally taregted. This means that ALRM will see a greater number of clients being able to move on and re-establish themseleves in their communities whilst staying out of the legal system. 
  
  If your client wishes to be referred to personalised servie providers, please click 'continue' and follow the onscreen instructions.
  
  If you do not wish to participate, please click on the 'exit' button which will take you to the ALRM website.
